	How fast match template works:
	1. Both target and source image are down sampled numDownPyrs times
	2. cvMatchTemplate() function is called on shrunken images
	   (uses CCORR_NORMED algorithm)
	3. The numMaxima best locations are found
	4. For each point where a maxima was located:
	   a) Original source image is searched at point +/- searchExpansion
		  pixels in both x and y direction
	5. If match score is above matchPercentage then the location and score is
	   saved in the foundPointsList and confidencesList, respectively
	6. If findMultipleTargets is true, an attempt will be made to find up to
	   numMaxima targets
	7. (Optional) The targets can be drawn to a color version of the source
	   image using the DrawFoundTargets() function

		  FastMatchTemplate
		  Performs a fast match template
		  Returns: true on success, false on failure
		  Parameters:
			source - source image (where we are searching)
			target - target image (what we are searching for)
			foundPointsList - contains a list of the points where the target was found
			confidencesList - contains a list of the confidence value (0-100) for each
							  found target
			matchPercentage - the minimum required match score to consider the target
							  found
			numMaxima - the maximum number of search locations to try before exiting
						(i.e. when image is down-sampled and searched, we collect the
						best numMaxima locations - those with the highest confidence -
						and search the original image at these locations)
			numDownPyrs - the number of times to down-sample the image (only increase
						  this number if your images are really large)
			searchExpansion - The original source image is searched at the top locations
							  with +/- searchExpansion pixels in both the x and y
							  directions
